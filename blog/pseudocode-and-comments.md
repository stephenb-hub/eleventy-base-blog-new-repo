For this task we needed to add Pseudocode to previous javascript challenges.

The teachers did a good job at explaining what it does and the purpose of Pseudocode.

It is a universal coding language to break down tasks which can then be translated into the respective code required.

I did find this a challenge as being new to coding, having to ignore any techniques i've already picked up was difficult.
